I wanted to use my python and data science skills to look for trends in LEGO sets.

I am using https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrpantherson/lego-sets, a data set on kaggle about LEGO sets from rebrickable, (which is a LEGO website database that tracks the prices of LEGO sets on the market).

You can click images to make them bigger, so that you can see them in more detail.

Enjoy.
